GitHub Actions workflows.

Ported from Utah Provo's app/integrations/github_actions.py (via CCSM's
fork), with _API_BASE repointed from pmgcompass-upm/PMG-Compass — then from
CCSM's own repo — to HSPSE's own: hspsempmgcompass-pixel/hspsem-pmg-compass

    silently dispatches whatever code is on main, even while this very
    module is being developed and tested on a feature branch that main
    doesn't have yet (that gap is what stalled the first live dispatch
    tests of this feature). Streamlit Cloud checks out the deployed
