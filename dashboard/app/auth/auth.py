auth.py
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two-layer authentication:
  Layer 1 — Streamlit Cloud SSO forces Google login (set app to Private).
  Layer 2 — Code-level allowlist: only approved emails get in regardless of SSO.

Approved emails:
  - ALWAYS_ALLOWED hardcoded list (HSPSE system account; Mission President once added — see TODO below)
  - Every Companion1_Email / Companion2_Email in MISSION_ORG — i.e. all 97 area
    mailboxes, NOT just APs. (An earlier version of this docstring said
    "Is_AP = TRUE"; get_allowed_emails() has never filtered on that flag.
    Verified against the live sheet: 97 addresses, all @missionary.org.)
  - STREAMLIT_DEV_EMAIL in secrets (LOCAL DEV ONLY — must be blank in production)

Consequence worth knowing before go-live: MISSION_ORG holds no
churchofjesuschrist.org addresses at all, so mission leadership cannot sign in
on the strength of the sheet alone — the Mission President must be added to
_ALWAYS_ALLOWED below or he is locked out of his own dashboard.

    Return the object carrying the signed-in viewer's identity, or None.

    Reads `st.experimental_user`, NOT `st.user`:
      - `st.user` does not exist at all before Streamlit 1.42, and
        requirements.txt pins 1.40.0 on purpose (see RUNNING.md) — so reading
        `st.user` raises AttributeError and every production visitor gets an
        error page. The dev bypass in require_auth() returns before this point,
        so running the app locally can never surface that.
      - From 1.42 on, `st.user` deliberately stops returning a Community Cloud
        account email unless you run your own OIDC provider. On Community
        Cloud, `st.experimental_user` is the one carrying the Google account.

    The `st.user` fallback covers only a future Streamlit that removes
    `experimental_user`. Both are probed with `is None`, never truthiness: an
    empty UserInfoProxy is falsy, so `a or b` would discard a real (empty)
    proxy and mask "signed in but no email" as "attribute missing".
