# "America/Santiago" when CCSM forked it and never updated this fallback for
# its own zone (a real bug there too — see the pattern). Chile/Honduras both
# run well off Denver's UTC-7/-6, so for the hours around local midnight

# zone — America/Tegucigalpa, all of Honduras, no DST (see
# HSPSEM_HANDOFF_ACCESS_CHECKLIST.md / the 2026-08-29 intake). Everything
# date-anchored depends on this being right: which day counts as missed,
# whether a streak survives, which week a submission lands in.
