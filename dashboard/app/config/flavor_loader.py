flavor_loader.py
Loads the active mission flavor from MISSION_FLAVOR env var.
Exposes a module-level `flavor` singleton used by all pages.

The flavor file supplies PRESENTATION only — display name, colours, coaching
tone. It does NOT supply the metric vocabulary: those properties read the live
QUESTIONS_CONFIG / SCORE_CONFIG instead (see FlavorConfig below for why). With
MISSION_FLAVOR unset the loader picks member_referral.json, which is Utah
Provo's flavor, so anything sourced from this file reaches CCSM as Provo's.

    # Provo's keys. Both halves of that were wrong for a live mission:
    #
    #   * MISSION_FLAVOR is unset here, so load_flavor() picks
    #     member_referral.json — Provo's own flavor. It DECLARES
    #     weekly_metrics/kpi_highlights/metric_groups as nm_lessons, lsi_given,
    #     pew, gate, locos_Attempt … so the fallbacks never even ran. Every
    #     consumer (the Dashboard KI row, Goals' KEY_METRICS, Scores' Daily
    #     Activity groups) was handed Provo's vocabulary against CCSM's data,
    #     and because every call site is `.get(key, key)` or `[c for c in cols
    #     if c in df.columns]`, that renders as zeroes and raw keys — never an
    #     error.
    #   * The fallbacks were a fifth hardcoded copy of the same dead catalogue.
    #
    # A flavor file describes a mission being SET UP (coaching tone, colours,
    # which questions to seed onto the forms). Once QUESTIONS_CONFIG exists it
    # is the only honest answer to "what does this mission measure", and it is
    # what the Apps Script agents read. So these read the catalogue and ignore
    # the JSON entirely — which also means dropping a differently-wrong flavor
    # file in place cannot resurrect this bug.
    #
    # Empty is a legitimate answer (unreadable tab, mission mid-setup) and must
    # stay empty: consumers render "no metrics configured". A baked-in default
    # here is exactly how the app came to display a mission's worth of metrics
    # nobody collects.
