"""
hspse_ingestion_settings.py — minimal .env-backed settings for the IMOS
roster runner. Deliberately NOT a port of Provo's app/config/settings.py —
that module carries many Provo-only fields (Church SSO, Tableau, Supabase)
this runner has no use for. Streamlit's own st.secrets is untouched by this;
Streamlit reads its own secrets.toml, this only serves the standalone CLI
runner (imos_transfer_runner.py), which runs outside any Streamlit context.
