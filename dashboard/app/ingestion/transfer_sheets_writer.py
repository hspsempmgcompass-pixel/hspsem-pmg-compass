"""
transfer_sheets_writer.py — Clears and rewrites the TRANSFER_IMPORT tab with
rows produced by transfer_roster_transform.build_transfer_rows.

Ported from Utah Provo's app/ingestion/transfer_sheets_writer.py, adapted to
call app.db.sheets_client.overwrite_tab() instead of the raw Sheets API —
HSPSE's sheets_client already has an equivalent clear+rewrite helper, so no
separate googleapiclient/service-account plumbing is needed here.

Mirrors the manual process's "select all, delete, paste" step exactly: one
all-or-nothing batched write, never partial rows.

This is a Streamlit-context-only function (needs st.secrets via
sheets_client) — the standalone CLI runner (imos_transfer_runner.py) has no
Streamlit context and writes to Sheets directly instead of importing this
module.
