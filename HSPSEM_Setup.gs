/**
 * ============================================================
 * HSPSEM_Setup.gs — Project triggers, smoke tests, operator entry points
 * PMG Compass | Honduras San Pedro Sula East Mission (HSPSEM) — Spanish fork
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Forked in spirit from docs/Setup.gs in PMG-Compass (Provo), which carries
 * the same "one file that installs every trigger" role. The schedule itself
 * is HSPSEM's own — see the table below — and every hour is MISSION-LOCAL, not
 * Provo-local.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * REQUIRED ONE-TIME MANUAL STEP — PROJECT TIMEZONE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Open the bound Apps Script project (COMPASS_HSPSE -> Extensions -> Apps
 * Script) -> Project Settings -> Time zone, and set it to:
 *
 *     (GMT-04:00) Tegucigalpa  —  America/Tegucigalpa
 *
 * Every trigger created below ALSO pins .inTimezone(getConfig('MISSION_TIMEZONE')),
 * so the schedule is correct even if the project setting is wrong — but the
 * Apps Script execution log, Logger timestamps and the trigger UI all read
 * from the PROJECT setting, so leaving it on the account default makes every
 * on-call diagnosis read hours off. Set it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PROJECT TRIGGER SCHEDULE (all times America/Tegucigalpa)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   runAgent3            Daily     6:00 AM   nightly refresh + missed-day alerts
 *   runAgent3Evening     Daily     9:00 PM   second daily refresh
 *   runAgent5A           Daily    12:00 PM   dashboard summary + WEEKLY_KI
 *   runAgent1A           Monday    9:15 PM   Monday coaching (chains 1B -> 1C)
 *   runAgent5B           Friday   12:00 PM   Friday encouragement (chains Agent6)
 *   runAgentReminder     Sunday    6:00 PM   NOTES reminders (+ weekly compliance, see below)
 *   runAgentDuplicate    Daily     9:30 PM   duplicate nightly-submission sweep
 *   runAgentEscalation   Daily     7:00 AM   escalation System 1 + System 2
 *   runAgent4            Monday    7:00 AM   system health check + self-heal
 *   runAgentScores       Monday   12:05 AM   weekly area scores
 *   runAgentMissionReport Monday  10:00 PM   mission-wide numbers for AP/MP
 *   runAgent2            (none)              MANUAL — run once per transfer
 *
 * Plus TWO installable form-submit triggers, which are NOT time-based and so
 * are not part of the table above (they fire when a missionary presses Submit,
 * not on a clock):
 *
 *   onNightlyFormSubmit  on submit   validation + duplicate detection (HSPSEM_AgentDuplicate.gs)
 *   onQAFormSubmit       on submit   question/suggestion handling    (HSPSEM_AgentQA.gs)
 *
 * setupAllHspsemTriggers() installs those two as well, and deliberately leaves
 * any already-installed form-submit trigger alone.
 *
 * runAgent2 is deliberately NOT scheduled: goal recalibration is a per-transfer
 * judgement call the mission president signs off on, not an automatic weekly
 * rewrite of every area's goals.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DEPLOYMENT DECISION THE MISSION MUST CONFIRM — WEEKLY_REMINDER_OWNER
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO agents can remind companionships who have not submitted the WEEKLY
 * form, and both build the SAME Spanish subject line
 * ("Recordatorio: Informe Semanal — <mission>"):
 *
 *   1. HSPSEM_AgentReminder.gs -> ar_checkWeeklyCompliance()
 *      One reminder per non-submitting area per week. No leader escalation.
 *      Only fires Monday/Tuesday, 8 AM–9 PM mission time.
 *   2. HSPSEM_AgentEscalation.gs -> runWeeklyEscalation()  ("System 2")
 *      Staged: Monday reminder 1 -> Tuesday reminder 2 -> Wednesday escalate
 *      to the District Leader.
 *
 * Left both enabled, every non-submitting companionship gets nagged TWICE on
 * Monday by two different agents. That failure mode has happened for real on
 * the Provo system this fork descends from; both source files already carried
 * a "pick one mechanism in production" warning that nothing enforced.
 *
 * AGENT_CONFIG key `WEEKLY_REMINDER_OWNER` now enforces it:
 *
 *   'AGENT_ESCALATION'  (SHIPPED DEFAULT) — System 2 owns weekly reminders;
 *                        ar_checkWeeklyCompliance() returns immediately.
 *   'AGENT_REMINDER'   — ar_checkWeeklyCompliance() owns them; System 2's
 *                        weekly half returns immediately (System 1, the
 *                        NIGHTLY escalation, is unaffected either way).
 *   'BOTH'             — gate disabled, both run. Duplicate reminders WILL be
 *                        sent. Present only so the behaviour is testable and
 *                        so nobody has to edit agent code to get it back.
 *
 * WHY AGENT_ESCALATION IS THE DEFAULT: the schedule above fires
 * runAgentReminder on SUNDAY at 6 PM, and ar_checkWeeklyCompliance() only
 * acts on Monday/Tuesday. On this schedule the AgentReminder path can never
 * fire at all, so choosing it would silently disable weekly reminders
 * entirely. runAgentEscalation runs DAILY at 7 AM, so System 2 reaches its
 * Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday stages normally. AgentReminder's Sunday trigger
 * still does its other, unrelated job: NOTES reminders.
 *
 * >>> If the mission would rather have the simpler one-and-done reminder with
 * >>> no District Leader escalation, set WEEKLY_REMINDER_OWNER =
 * >>> 'AGENT_REMINDER' *and* move the runAgentReminder trigger to Monday, or
 * >>> the reminders will never send. Confirm this choice before go-live.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SHIP STATE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AGENT_CONFIG ships with TEST_MODE = TRUE and TEST_INBOX_EMAIL =
 * hspsem.pmg.compass@gmail.com, so EVERY email any agent sends is redirected to
 * that inbox and prefixed [TEST]. No trigger is created automatically —
 * setupAllHspsemTriggers() exists but nothing calls it. A human must open the
 * editor and run it. Do not go live until the mission has read the
 * WEEKLY_REMINDER_OWNER decision above and TEST_MODE has been flipped
 * deliberately (HSPSEM_AgentTestMode.gs disableTestMode()).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OPERATOR ENTRY POINTS (all ZERO-ARGUMENT — the editor's Run button passes
 * no arguments and there is no console)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   setupAllHspsemTriggers()     converge this project's triggers to the table
 *                              above + the two form-submit triggers. Safe to
 *                              re-run; it is the ONLY trigger installer an
 *                              operator should ever need.
 *   deleteAllHspsemTriggers()    remove every trigger in this project, including
 *                              the two form-submit ones
 *   smokeTestPipeline()        read-only pre-flight; sends nothing, writes nothing
 *   previewOneCoachingEmail()  one sample coaching email to the test inbox
 *
 * The editor's function dropdown also still lists the older per-agent
 * installers. They fall into three groups:
 *
 *   setupReminderTrigger(), setupEscalationTriggers(),
 *   setupSuggestionNotifyTrigger(), setupAgent1ATrigger(),
 *   setupAgent4Trigger(), setupAgent5ATrigger() — each of these disagreed
 *   with HSPSEM_TRIGGER_SCHEDULE (the first three installed OFF-TABLE handler
 *   names entirely; the latter three installed the right handler on a
 *   SCHEDULE that had drifted from the table — Agent1A on Sunday vs the
 *   table's Monday, Agent4 on Tue+Sat vs the table's Monday-only, Agent5A
 *   daily vs the table's weekly Sunday). Each is now a delegating shim:
 *   running one by mistake converges the project rather than silently
 *   replacing the canonical schedule with a stale one. See "LEGACY
 *   PER-AGENT INSTALLERS" below.
 *
 *   setupAgentMissionReportTrigger() — brand new (Phase 6, no legacy
 *   history to drift from), but built as a shim from day one rather than a
 *   direct installer: after finding three direct installers drift silently
 *   above, "install directly, hope it never gets edited independently" is
 *   the pattern to stop repeating, not extend.
 *
 *   setupAgentDuplicateTrigger(), setupQAFormTrigger() — these two still
 *   install directly, and must: they create the form-submit triggers in
 *   HSPSEM_FORM_SUBMIT_TRIGGERS, which setupAllHspsemTriggers() installs by
 *   calling them. Delegating would recurse. They are already idempotent
 *   (each deletes its own handler first), so running one by hand is safe.
 *
 *   setupAgent3Trigger(), setupAgent3EveningTrigger(), setupAgent5BTrigger(),
 *   setupAgentScoresTrigger(), setupAgent2OnceTrigger() — these install
 *   directly too, but their schedules already MATCH the table (or, for
 *   Agent2, are the documented manual/one-shot path — Agent2 is
 *   deliberately not on the table at all). deleteTriggerByName() clears the
 *   canonical trigger first, so running one by hand just recreates the same
 *   schedule under a new trigger ID — harmless, left as direct installers.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * LEGACY PER-AGENT INSTALLERS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before this file existed, each agent shipped its own setup*Trigger()
 * function. Three of them installed handler names that are NOT in
 * HSPSEM_TRIGGER_SCHEDULE at all:
 *
 *   setupReminderTrigger()          runReminderAgent, HOURLY
 *   setupEscalationTriggers()       runNightlyEscalation 10:00, runWeeklyEscalation 20:45
 *   setupSuggestionNotifyTrigger()  notifyAcceptedSuggestions, every 10 minutes
 *
 * Left as they were, an operator picking one out of the dropdown would get
 * escalation firing at 07:00 AND 10:00 AND 20:45 and the reminder agent
 * firing hourly — the exact duplicate-nagging failure WEEKLY_REMINDER_OWNER
 * exists to prevent, through a different door.
 *
 * A second audit (2026-08-01, while retiming Agent1A for Phase 5) found
 * three MORE that install the correct handler name but on a schedule that
 * had drifted from the table — worse, because deleteTriggerByName() means
 * running one doesn't just add a duplicate, it DELETES the canonical
 * trigger and replaces it with the stale one:
 *
 *   setupAgent1ATrigger()  installed Monday (table said Sunday until this fix)
 *   setupAgent4Trigger()   installs Tuesday + Saturday 7 AM (table: Monday only)
 *   setupAgent5ATrigger()  installs DAILY at noon (table: weekly, Sunday 10 PM)
 *
 * All six are therefore now delegating shims (they log what they used to
 * do, then converge).
 *
 * >>> ONE CONSEQUENCE THE MISSION MUST CONFIRM: notifyAcceptedSuggestions()
 * >>> (AgentQA's "email COMPASS when a suggestion is finally approved" poll)
 * >>> is not on HSPSEM_TRIGGER_SCHEDULE, so after convergence it is NOT
 * >>> scheduled at all. The function still exists and is zero-argument, so it
 * >>> can be run by hand. If the mission wants it automated, add a row to
 * >>> HSPSEM_TRIGGER_SCHEDULE (a daily hour is plenty; the original 10-minute
 * >>> poll burns ~144 executions/day for a low-volume queue) rather than
 * >>> re-enabling the old installer.
